        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>
            The Central Utah Tree Festival was born from a simple observation: when children in our rural
            community need specialized medical care, their families face an impossible choice between
            their child's health and their family's financial stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2024, a group of neighbors and friends in Sanpete County came together with a vision—to
            create something beautiful that could make a real difference. We knew our community was full
            of generous hearts, creative spirits, and people who care deeply about their neighbors. The
            Central Utah Tree Festival became our way of channeling that love into meaningful support.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-box">
            "What started as a conversation around a kitchen table has grown into an annual tradition
            that brings our entire community together in support of our most vulnerable families."
        </div>
        <p>
            From that first festival, we've been amazed by the creativity, generosity, and compassion
            of our community. Every decorated tree tells a story. Every bid at our auction represents
            hope. Every volunteer hour is an investment in a child's future.

    <!-- The Problem We're Solving -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Journey No Family Should Face Alone</h2>
        <p>
            Living in rural Sanpete County offers many blessings—tight-knit communities, beautiful
            landscapes, and a quality of life many people dream of. But when a child faces a serious
            medical condition, that rural setting becomes a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City is one of the nation's premier pediatric
            medical centers, offering specialized care that can mean the difference between life and
            death for critically ill children. For families in Sanpete County, accessing that care
            means traveling over 100 miles each way.
        </p>

        <h3>The Hidden Costs of Distance</h3>
        <p>
            When a child needs ongoing treatment, those miles add up to more than just inconvenience:
        </p>
        <div class="stats-grid">
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">120+ Miles</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Round trip to Salt Lake City</span>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">Multiple Trips</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Often required for treatment</span>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">Lost Work</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Parents missing shifts and wages</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Gas, parking, meals, and sometimes overnight stays pile up quickly. For families already
            stretched thin, these expenses can force impossible decisions. Parents skip meals to pay
            for gas. Siblings stay with relatives for days at a time. Medical debt grows alongside
            the fear and exhaustion of caring for a sick child.
        </p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "No parent should have to choose between putting gas in the car to get their child to
            treatment and putting food on the table for their family."
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Mission & Vision -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Our Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The Central Utah Tree Festival exists for one purpose: to ensure that every child in
            Sanpete County can access the specialized medical care they need, regardless of their
            family's financial circumstances.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
            We provide direct financial assistance to families traveling to Primary Children's Hospital
            for their child's medical care. Our support covers the practical costs that insurance
            doesn't: gas for the long drive, parking fees at the hospital, meals during all-day
            appointments, and lodging when overnight stays are necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every dollar we raise goes directly to helping families. We're an entirely volunteer-run
            organization, which means 100% of donations support the families who need it most.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Work</h3>
        <p>
            Families can apply for support through a simple, confidential process. We work quickly to
            provide assistance when it's needed most—because we know that medical needs don't wait.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p>
            We envision a community where no family faces the journey to specialized care alone. Where
            neighbors support neighbors. Where financial barriers never stand between a child and the
            treatment they need. And where an annual celebration of creativity and generosity reminds
            us all of what we can accomplish together.
