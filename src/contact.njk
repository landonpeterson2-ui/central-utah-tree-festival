        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How do I apply for support?</h3>
        <p>
            Families in Sanpete County can apply for support through our online application form.
            We process applications quickly and work to provide assistance when it's needed most.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I volunteer?</h3>
        <p>
            We're always looking for volunteers to help with our annual festival, tree setup and delivery,
            event coordination, and more. Please email us to learn about current volunteer opportunities.
        </p>

        <h3>Can my business sponsor a tree?</h3>
        <p>
            Absolutely! Business sponsorships are a wonderful way to support our mission while gaining
            visibility in the community. Contact us to discuss sponsorship opportunities.

        <h3>Where do donations go?</h3>
        <p>
            100% of donations go directly to supporting families. We provide assistance with gas, meals,
            parking, and lodging for families traveling to Primary Children's Hospital. We're an entirely
            volunteer-run organization with no paid staff.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the next festival?</h3>
        <p>
            Our festival typically takes place during the holiday season. Follow us on social media
